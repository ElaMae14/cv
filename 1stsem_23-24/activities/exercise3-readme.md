### Exercise 3 Adding an image, external link
1. Get a copy of the image file on your hard drive so you can see it in place when you open the file locally.
2. Once youâ€™ve got the image, insert it at the beginning of the first-level heading by typing in the img element and its attributes as shown here:
<h1><img src="blackgoose.gif" alt="Black Goose
logo" />Black Goose Bistro</h1>
The src attribute provides the name of the image file that should be inserted, and the alt attribute provides text that should be displayed if the image is not available. Both of these attributes are required in every img element.

Figure 3 shows how it should look now
